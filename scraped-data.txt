Howdy Founders,

📰 It's April: Skiing season’s over. 95% of you squinted at the eclipse yesterday and you forgot to RSVP to our event with Michele Romanow and Andrew Wilkinson April 24th. J-Trudeau and the gov invested $2.4B into AI. Serena Williams (who we still need to get in for an AMA) has invested in 14 unicorns. RBC bought HSBC for $13 billion. Andddd LOI Foudners are quitting their jobs left, right and centre to go ALL IN on their startups.

Special shoutout to the founders jumping ship from their main gig when the path to profitability looks harder to find than that tiny solar eclipse dot we were all searching for yesterday 🧐


All jokes aside, big ups goes to:

Aidan + Finn for going all in on Reserv Labs

Andy Ly for going all in on Chakra Nutrition

And many more we’re likely missing

Fun fact: We’re popping bottles in your honour as you read this 🍾 


Quick pop quiz…

Should we start a section in the newsletter where we name the “Latest Founder to Quit their 9-5 and Go All In" on Their Startup?
Hell yes

Nah, a "first to hit $1m in sales" list would be cooler

Neither, focus on getting Serena Williams's EA to reply to your email to come give an AMA to LOI founders

🗞 More Timely LOI News…

🎬 How to Succeed in Your 20s

A couple weeks ago at an LOI event, we asked Wes Kao (Cofounder of Maven and bestie boos with the Marketing God Seth Godin) what was the highest value decision she made in her 20s.

Her answer?

“writing and building an audience online”

It’s now a question we can’t stop thinking about.

And it seems like Andrew Yeung is someone who also thinks a ton about it. So much so, that he spun up a blog about how to win in your 20s.

If you haven’t had a cortado with Andrew yet, here’s a bit about his background. He’s:

help product roles at Google and Meta,

advised and invested in early-stage startups,

worked as an investment partner at a $1B venture fund,

and built his own startup which allowed him to quit his job


In his newsletter, he wrote about frameworks to win in your 20s. We loved it. So we wanted to re-share it with you. His big 7 were:

Climb more hills

Create proof that you can do hard things.

Strive to give first (and don’t keep score.)

Learn to communicate clearly.

Meet 1 new person every week.

Occasionally, break free from the herd.

Understand that compensation growth is non-linear.
