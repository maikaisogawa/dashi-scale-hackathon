who

how do investors find companies? 
as I began my founder journey, the importance of network and visibility became crystal clear. 
for a founder, how do you share what you're building in the right circles? 
as a vc, where can you find the best founders, especially the ones that may be non-obvious or lesser known? 

what

discover hidden investment opportunities with Dashi

why

i'm building dashi to deal-source promising startups and founders.
i'm also building dashi to reduce the natural gap that exists for minorities due to traditional sourcing methods (network, access).
